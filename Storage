<h3>Geologic Movements</h3>
 <div id="Geologic Movements">
     <p>The earth is made up of layers called <strong>tectonic plates</strong> and these plates lay along a layer of magma benetah the crust called mantle.
      The mantle constantly created a cycle beneath the earth which is also known as <strong>Mantle Convection</strong>. This process causes the plates to and shift over a period of time and eventually causes
     them to come against each other <strong>(Insurgent)</strong>, break away from each other <strong>(Divergent)</strong> and slide against each other <strong>(Transform)</strong>. The tension released from these movements
       is brought to the surface and causes different natural disasters.</p></div>

    <p>Depending on the environment, they can trigger massive atural disasters. In area that is uneven or lays on a slope, sudden movements or actions
      can shift a large amount of ice, mud, or rocks downward damaging villages or towns. Depending on the weather, large amounts of precipitation could 
      cause large amounts of flooding to affect other communities.</p></div>

<h3>Atmospheric Conditions</h3>
    <div id="Atmospheric Conditions">
      <p>The atmospheric conditions can create large wind masses of cold air that come into contact with warm moist air over land or bodies of water and create large storms.
      These storms can create devastation on land through high speed funnels or slowly gain power as they pass over a large body of water and absorb warm air to further intensify
     their ferocity as they pass over a coast.</p></div>

     <p>When disasters strike, there are always actions or improvements made to further increase everyones safety and be more prepared.
      Here are various ways to respond when a natural disaster occurs that fall into four different categories.</p>
